Container Assets for Cities Skylines 1.0
by cyricc

./baked contains the fbx models and png textures. Put these into your skylines Import directory to import into the asset editor. See http://www.skylineswiki.com/Asset_Editor#Specifications_for_imported_assets for more information.

./source contains the blend files and psd textures. These might be more convenient for editing, especially if you would like to look at the uv maps.

Enjoy
